Based on the error message, we need to make changes to properly handle the PWA registration. The error suggests we need to either:

1. Add the PWA plugin to Vite config
2. Or remove the PWA registration import if not using PWA functionality

The most likely files that need changes are:

1. `vite.config.ts` - To add the PWA plugin
2. `src/main.tsx` - To either remove the virtual import or properly configure it

Please add these 2 files to the chat so I can propose the exact changes needed.

The error specifically shows the problem is with the import "virtual:pwa-register" in main.tsx, and we likely need to configure this in vite.config.ts.

Would you like me to see:
1. The vite configuration to add PWA support?
2. Or just remove the PWA registration if not needed? 

Let me know which approach you prefer and I'll help modify the files accordingly once you share them.

I see the issue - the PWA registration code is being included in both development and production, but the VitePWA plugin is only enabled in development mode. Let's fix this by either:

1. Removing the PWA registration entirely if not needed
2. Or properly enabling the VitePWA plugin for both environments

Since you already have PWA configuration in the vite.config.ts, I'll assume you want to keep the PWA functionality. Here are the changes:

vite.config.ts
```typescript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    mode === 'development' &&    VitePWA({
=======
    VitePWA({
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

src/main.tsx
```typescript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Register service worker for PWA functionality
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  if (import.meta.env.PROD) {
    registerSW({ immediate: true });
  } else {
    // Clean up any existing service workers in development
    navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(registrations => {
      registrations.forEach(registration => registration.unregister());
    });
  }
}
=======
// Register service worker for PWA functionality
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  registerSW({
    immediate: true,
    onRegistered(registration) {
      if (registration) {
        console.log('Service Worker registered')
      }
    },
    onRegisterError(error) {
      console.error('Service Worker registration failed', error)
    }
  });
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will:
1. Enable the VitePWA plugin for both development and production
2. Simplify the service worker registration to use the same logic in both environments
3. Add better error handling and logging

Try rebuilding after making these changes.

```bash
npm run build
```
