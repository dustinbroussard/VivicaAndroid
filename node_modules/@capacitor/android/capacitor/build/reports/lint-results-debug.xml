        severity="Information"
        message="6 errors were filtered out because they are listed in the baseline file, lint-baseline.xml"

        priority="10"
        summary="Baseline Applied"
        explanation="Lint can be configured with a &quot;baseline&quot;; a set of current issues found in a codebase, which future runs of lint will silently ignore. Only new issues not found in the baseline are reported.&#xA;&#xA;Note that while opening files in the IDE, baseline issues are not filtered out; the purpose of baselines is to allow you to get started using lint and break the build on all newly introduced errors, without having to go back and fix the entire codebase up front. However, when you open up existing files you still want to be aware of and fix issues as you come across them.&#xA;&#xA;This issue type is used to emit an informational-only warning if any issues were filtered out due to baseline matching. That way, you don&apos;t have a false sense of security if you forgot that you&apos;ve checked in a baseline file.">

    <issue
        id="LintBaselineFixed"
        severity="Information"
        message="6 errors/warnings were listed in the baseline file (lint-baseline.xml) but not found in the project; perhaps they have been fixed? Another possible explanation is that lint recently stopped analyzing (and including results from) dependent projects by default. You can turn this back on with `android.lintOptions.checkDependencies=true`. Unmatched issue types: DefaultLocale, Overdraw, Recycle, SetJavaScriptEnabled, StaticFieldLeak (2)"

        priority="10"
        summary="Baselined Issues Fixed"
        explanation="If a lint baseline describes a problem which is no longer reported, then the problem has either been fixed, or perhaps the issue type has been disabled. In any case, the entry can be removed from the baseline (such that if the issue is reintroduced at some point, lint will complain rather than just silently starting to match the old baseline entry again.)">
