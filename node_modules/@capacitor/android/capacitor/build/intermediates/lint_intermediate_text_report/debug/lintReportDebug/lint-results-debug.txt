/home/dusitn/VivicaAndroid/node_modules/@capacitor/android/capacitor/lint-baseline.xml: Information: 6 errors/warnings were listed in the baseline file (lint-baseline.xml) but not found in the project; perhaps they have been fixed? Another possible explanation is that lint recently stopped analyzing (and including results from) dependent projects by default. You can turn this back on with android.lintOptions.checkDependencies=true. Unmatched issue types: DefaultLocale, Overdraw, Recycle, SetJavaScriptEnabled, StaticFieldLeak (2) [LintBaselineFixed]

   Explanation for issues of type "LintBaselineFixed":
   If a lint baseline describes a problem which is no longer reported, then
   the problem has either been fixed, or perhaps the issue type has been
   disabled. In any case, the entry can be removed from the baseline (such
   that if the issue is reintroduced at some point, lint will complain rather
   than just silently starting to match the old baseline entry again.)

0 errors, 0 warnings (6 errors filtered by baseline lint-baseline.xml)
